Basically a computer has multiple processors which permits the threads to be used at the same time.

Application that use multiple threads are called multi threads.

Strategies to Thread Safety :
(code that can be thread-safe)
Confinement (not to share data between thread) (restricting data)

Immutability. Calling Immutable objects.

Synchronization. Preventing multiple threads to access to the same thing. we put locks
Here we can have problems in deadlock.

Atomic class. This helps us thread safe without using locks.

Partitioning.
